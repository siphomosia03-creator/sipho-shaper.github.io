Hi, I am Sipho Mosia

I am passionate about the world of data, artificial intelligence, and law, and how 
these fields link to shape decesion-making, innovation and society.

I am interested in using data-driven insights and AI-powered tools to solve real life
problems while staying mindful of ethics, governance, and the legal frameworks.

My goal is to become a Data Analyst and Legislature of AI laws within the South African legal sector, 
by applying advanced analytics to support legal research, policy development, and evidence-based decision making.

This space is where I share my learning journey, showcase projects, and experiment with ideas that 
bridge technology, policy and impact.




My Portfolio and Learning Roadmap


MINI BIO

I am an aspiring data analyst with a legal background (LLB), I am interested in using data science to improve 
decision-making in the justice system and professional sport. I’m passionate about applying data analysis and 
predictive insights to save time, reduce bias, and support evidence-based outcomes for lawyers, courts, and athletes.




TARGET ROLE

Target Role: Data Analyst
I am targeting a data analyst role because it aligns naturally with my legal training in evidence analysis, pattern recognition, 
and clear communication. Right now is the right time because I’m intentionally bridging law with data science to explore how analytics 
can improve efficiency, consistency, and fairness in legal decisions, while also applying similar analytical thinking to 
sports performance and strategy.




SEED PROJECT IDEAS

Project Idea 1: Legal Predictive Analytics
Analyse historical bail hearings datasets to explore factors influencing whether bail is granted. The project would focus on 
identifying patterns, testing simple predictive models, and discussing ethical limitations such as bias, fairness, and transparency in legal AI.

Project Idea 2: Sports Analytics
Analyse sport matches or player performance data to identify opponent tendencies, performance trends, and 
decision patterns with insights relevant to teams, coaches, and officials.

Project Idea 3: Shares Analytics
Analyse the shares history in the Johannesburg Stock Exchange and current affairs to predict which companies shares
are more likely to increase, with the aim of assisting investors and ordinary South Africans to invest wisely.




SKILLS TO GROW

Technical Skill: Python for data analysis and basic machine learning (pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn)
These skills supports both legal and sports analytics, especially for cleaning case data, building simple 
predictive models, and exploring outcome probabilities.

Soft Skill: Analytical communication & ethical reasoning
Explaining complex data-driven insights clearly to non-technical stakeholders (lawyers, judges, coaches) 
and addressing limitations and bias.




GOALS: SHORT & LONG-TERM

30-Day Goal:
Learn Python fundamentals for data analysis and complete one small exploratory analysis on a public dataset 
(legal or sports-related), focusing on clean visuals and clear written insights.
6-Month Goal:
Build and publish at least two portfolio projects (one legal analytics project and one sports analytics project) 
on GitHub, including a written reflection on findings, limitations, and ethical considerations in predictive analytics.
