Hi, I am Sipho Mosia

I am passionate about the world of data, artificial intelligence, and law, and how 
these fields link to shape decesion-making, innovation and society.

I am interested in using data-driven insights and AI-powered tools to solve real life
problems while staying mindful of ethics, governance, and the legal frameworks.

My goal is to become a Data Analyst and Legislature of AI laws within the South African legal sector, 
by applying advanced analytics to support legal research, policy development, and evidence-based decision making.

This space is where I share my learning journey, showcase projects, and experiment with ideas that 
bridge technology, policy and impact.
